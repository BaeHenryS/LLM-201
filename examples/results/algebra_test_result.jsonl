{"problem": "What is the following value when expressed as a common fraction: $$\\frac{1}{2^{1}}+\\frac{1}{2^{2}}+\\frac{1}{2^{3}}+\\cdots + \\frac{1}{2^{8}}+\\frac{1}{2^{9}}+\\frac{1}{2^{10}}?$$", "level": "Level 4", "type": "Algebra", "solution": "This is a finite geometric series with first term $\\frac{1}{2}$, common ratio $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $10$ terms. Therefore the sum is: $$\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2^{10}}\\right)}{1-\\frac{1}{2}}\n=\\frac{\\frac{2^{10}-1}{2^{11}}}{\\frac{1}{2}}\n= \\frac{2^{10}-1}{2^{10}}=\\boxed{\\frac{1023}{1024}}.$$", "ai_solution": "The given expression is a geometric series with first term $a = \\frac{1}{2}$ and common ratio $r = \\frac{1}{2}$. The sum of a geometric series is given by the formula\n$$S_n = \\frac{a(1 - r^n)}{1 - r},$$\nwhere $S_n$ is the sum of the first $n$ terms.\n\nPlugging in the values $a = \\frac{1}{2}$, $r = \\frac{1}{2}$, and $n = 10$, we get\n$$S_{10} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{10})}{1 - \\frac{1}{2}}.$$\nSimplifying, we find that\n$$S_{10} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\frac{1}{1024})}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 1 - \\frac{1}{1024} = \\frac{1023}{1024}.$$\n\nTherefore, the sum of the given expression as a common fraction is $\\boxed{\\frac{1023}{1024}}$.", "correct": true}
