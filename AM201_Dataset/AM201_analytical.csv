,"This column is for writing prompts. Should be asking the model to do something or ask a question to answer. Should be in LaTeX and the question should give more details if possible, such as the methodology to solve the problem. The question style should closely align with the one on the homework, but be more specific in the instructions. Remove all other text that pertains to the format of the output, but you can put information about what the equation should be in terms of. ","This column is for writing solution to the prompt. You can write the explaining text part relatively free form but for key answers please write as a print function. For example, if answer is 3, we can write it as: $\\boxed{3}$",Indicates what chapter of Michael's AM201 Book the problem is from. 
1,"""Nondimensionalize the following polynomial equation $a_0 x^5-a_1 x+a_2=0.$  ","""we are interested in how the solution depends on the parameters $a_0, a_1, a_2$. Let us write $x=a_2 / a_1 y$, and substitute this into (3.2). This substitution yields $a_0\left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^5 y^5-a_2(y-1)=0 $ Now dividing through by $a_2$ yields $\frac{a_0}{a_2}\left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^5 y^5-y+1=0.$ If we now define $ \epsilon=\frac{a_0 a_2^4}{a_1^5}$ the equation is $\epsilon x^5-x+1=0.$ So the answer is $\\boxed{\epsilon x^5-x+1=0}$",4

,"Solve for the roots of the following polynomial $P(x)$ in terms of $\epsilon$: \[P(x) =\epsilon x^{2} + x + 1.\] 
 Use the method of dominant balance to find approximations for all roots for both small and large $\epsilon$.","Consider the problem of form $A+B+C=0$, with $A$, $B$, and $C$ corresponding to the three terms in $P(x)$:\[A=\epsilon x^{2}/]; \[B=x/]; \[C=1/].
 We now consider the three possible dominant balances, solving for the roots of each and evaluating whether each balance holds for large or small $\epsilon$.\vspace{1em}
 
 We start with the balance $A+B=0$; solving for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ then gives us1 roots: 
 \[\epsilon x^{2} + x=0 \]\[ \implies \boxed{ x=\left[ - \frac{1}{\epsilon}\right]}\]
 To Verify the roots found for consistency, we check that $|A|,|B|>>|C|$ holds for this root by substituting our found root expression for $x$ back into $A$, $B$, and $C$ and comparing their magnitudes. Using this method, we find the following:
 
 Validity for small $\epsilon$: True
 Validity for large $\epsilon$: False
 
 \underline{Therefore, these roots are valid for small $\epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1em}
 
 Next we use the balance $B+C=0$, and solving this for $x$ in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us 1 roots:\[x + 1=0\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ -1\right]}\]
 Checking the consistency that $|B|,|C|>>|A|$, we substitute the root back into A, B, and C to check their magnitudes:
 
 Validity for small $\epsilon$: True
 Validity for large $\epsilon$: False
 
 \underline{Therefore these are roots for small $\epsilon$}\vspace{1em}
 
 Next we use the balance $A+C=0$, solving for x in terms of $\epsilon$ gives us
 2 roots:\[\epsilon x^{2} + 1=0\]\[ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ - \sqrt{- \frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \ \sqrt{- \frac{1}{\epsilon}}\right]}\]
 Checking the consistency that $|A|,|C|>>|B|$, we substitute the root back into A, B, and C to check their magnitudes:
 
 Validity for small $\epsilon$: False
 Validity for large $\epsilon$: True
 
 \underline{Therefore these are roots for large $\epsilon$}\vspace{1em}

,"The third-order ODE is given by the following equation: $$- y_{3} = - \left(\frac{d}{d x} y{\left(x \right)}\right)^{2} - \frac{1}{25 x^{4} - 20 x^{2} - 10 x + \cos{\left(x \right)} - 2} + \frac{y{\left(x \right)}}{4 x^{3} + 4 x^{2} - 3 x + 3} + \frac{\frac{d^{2}}{d x^{2}} y{\left(x \right)}}{9 x^{3} + 6 x^{2} + 4}$$ and has initial conditions, $y(0)=1, y'(0)=0, y''(0)=0$. Using the method of dominant balance, find analytical solutions that approximate the solution to the ODE at (a) very small x and (b) large x.","The dominant balance in the small x regime is given by $$\frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y{\left(x \right)} = - \frac{1}{25 x^{4} - 20 x^{2} - 10 x + \cos{\left(x \right)} - 2},$$ and the dominant balance in the large x regime is given by $$\frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}} y = - \frac{1}{25 x^{4} - 20 x^{2} - 10 x + \cos{\left(x \right)} - 2}$$ Using the dominant balance in the small x regime, the solution can be derived by setting $x=0$, analytically solving the dominant balance equation for y, and plugging in the initial conditions. The solution is thus $$y{\left(x \right)} = \frac{x^{3}}{6} + 1$$ in the small x regime. The solution for the large x regime uses an ansatz of the form $$ y=\alpha (x-x^*)^p, $$ where $x^*$ is the divergence point. Plugging in the ansatz and solving for the terms yields $$\alpha p \left(p - 2\right) \left(p - 1\right) \left(x - 8.09080908090809\right)^{p - 3} = - \alpha^{2} p^{2} \left(x - 8.09080908090809\right)^{2 p - 2}$$",
