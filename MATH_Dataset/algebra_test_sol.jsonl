{"problem": "Twelve people purchased supplies for a ten-day camping trip with the understanding that each of the twelve will get equal daily shares. They are then joined by three more people, but make no further purchases. How many days will the supplies last if the original daily share for each person is not changed?", "target_solution": "Since each person of the original group had 10 daily shares, the total supplies are equivalent to 120 daily shares. When 3 people join the group, the total number of people becomes 15. Then each person in the new group will have $\\frac{120}{15}$ or 8 daily shares. The supplies will last $\\boxed{8}$ days.", "gpt_solution": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of person-days. The total person-days of supplies is constant, so we can set up the equation:\n\n12 people * 10 days = 15 people * x days\n\nSolving for x, we find:\n\nx = (12 * 10) / 15 = 8\n\nTherefore, the supplies will last for 8 days. \n\n$\\boxed{8}$", "score": 1}
{"problem": "The $n^{\\text{th}}$ term of a certain geometric series is given by $a\\cdot r^{n-1}$, where $a$ and $r$ are positive integers and $r$ is greater than 1. Bill picks out $k$ different numbers in this sequence, all of which have the same number of digits. What is the largest possible value of $k$?", "target_solution": "Suppose the smallest of Bill's numbers is $b$. The next few terms of the sequence are $br$, $br^2$, $br^3$, $br^4$, and so on. Since $r$ is at least 2, $br^4$ is at least $16b$. Since $16b > 10b$, and $10b$ has one more digit than $b$, $16b$ has more digits than $b$, and therefore $br^4$ has more digits than $b$. Since the series increases, $br^5$, $br^6$, and so on all have more digits than $b$. Therefore, Bill's numbers are restricted to $b$, $br$, $br^2$, and $br^3$; that is, he can have at most 4 numbers. An example of this is the sequence $1,\\,2,\\,4,\\,8,\\,16,\\ldots$, where Bill's numbers are 1, 2, 4, and 8. Hence, the largest possible value of $k$ is $\\boxed{4}$.", "gpt_solution": "The largest possible value of $k$ is the largest possible number of consecutive terms in the geometric series that have the same number of digits. \n\nLet's consider the first few terms of the geometric series:\n\\[a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, ar^4, \\ldots\\]\n\nWe want to find the largest possible number of consecutive terms that have the same number of digits.
