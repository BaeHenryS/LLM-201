      "P = 2 * (length + width)\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the problem, the perimeter is 24 inches. Let's call the length (L) and the width (W).\n",

      "So we have:\n",
      "\n",
      "2 * (L + W) = 24\n",

      "Divide both sides by 2 to solve for (L + W):\n",

      "Now for the area (A) of the rectangle:\n",

      "A = L * W\n",

      "To find the maximum possible area, we recognize that for a given perimeter, a rectangle becomes a square. This is because a square is a special case of a rectangle where all sides are equal, and it is the shape that maximizes area for a given perimeter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the sum of the length and the width is 12, and for a square, the length and width are equal, we can divide that sum by 2 to find the length of one side of this square.\n",

      "The area of this square (which is the maximum possible area for a rectangle with a perimeter of 24 inches)\n",
      "Actual Solution: Let one pair of parallel sides have length $x$ and the other pair of parallel sides have length $12-x$. This means that the perimeter of the rectangle is $x+x+12-x+12-x=24$ as the problem states. The area of this rectangle is $12x-x^2$. Completing the square results in $-(x-6)^2+36\\le 36$ since $(x-6)^2\\ge 0$, so the maximum area of $\\boxed{36}$ is obtained when the rectangle is a square of side length 6 inches.\n",

      "Problem: What is the sum of all values of $y$ for which the expression $\\frac{y+6}{y^2-5y+4}$ is undefined?\n",
